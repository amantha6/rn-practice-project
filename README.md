Expo CLI vs React Native CLI

The React Native CLI is more bare-bones and doesn't provide those pre-defined features by default. This gives you more control but requires more manual configuration.

**Project Structure Notes**


.expo and .expo_shared contain configuration and settings
assets holds images and other static resources
node_modules contains dependencies and packages
.gitignore specifies which files to exclude from version control
App.js is the main entry point of your application
app.json contains project details and configuration
babel.config.js handles JavaScript compilation settings
